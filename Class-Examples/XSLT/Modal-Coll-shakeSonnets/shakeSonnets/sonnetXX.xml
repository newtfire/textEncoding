    <line>A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,</line>
    <line>Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;</line>
    <line>A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted</line>
    <line>With shifting change, as is false women's fashion:</line>
    <line>An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,</line>
    <line>Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;</line>
    <line>A man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,</line>
    <line>Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.</line>
    <line>And for a woman wert thou first created;</line>
    <line>Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,</line>
    <line>And by addition me of thee defeated,</line>
    <line>By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.</line>
    <line>But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,</line>
    <line>Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.</line>
