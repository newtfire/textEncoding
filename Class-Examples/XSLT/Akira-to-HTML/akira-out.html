                  We've gotta get out of here, Kei?

                  Get in.
                  What's wrong? Hurry.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  I'll meet you shortly.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  You know the rendezvous point, right?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - Be careful.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - Kei, it's you!

               <li>
                  Who's this?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - Well, is he a spy or not?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  They're last-minute orders,
                  and the plan is in place already.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  We're to gather detailed
                  data on the new subject.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - Yes.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Last week, on the same night we tried to abduct
                  the experimental subject called number 26...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  a boy who was in an accident
                  on an old city highway was brought to the lab.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  It seems that he's a student
                  at a vocational training school...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  but now he's their new subject
                  for human experimentation.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - Maybe he did it just to get close to us.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  He knows the subject and I think we can
                  use him as a decoy if we find it necessary.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  What is it?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Be careful.
                  It's deeper in the middle.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Damn! Hug the walls!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Looks like they beefed up security,
                  doesn't it?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - No. Let's keep going.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  I want to check their security
                  at the very least.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Damn! They spotted us!
                  Run for it!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - Forget it! Run!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  It's coming back!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Don't shoot!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Kei! Over here!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Now!

                  Mr. Nezu, I......

               <li>
                  I came to apologize, sir.

               <li>
                  The mission was a failure.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  My two best men, they're dead.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Everyone was killed.

                  due to tax reforms enacted by the former

                  There is confusion among parliament members

               <li>
                  of Finance Minister Takanashi

                  In fact, they're hard to come by, so the price

                  I customized that bike for myself.
                  It's too wild. You couldn't handle it.

                  Ha! If you want it so bad
                  then steal one yourself.

               </li>
               <li>
                  Damn it. My motor coils were
                  just getting warmed up.

               <li>

               </li>
               <li>
                  Excuse me, please?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Uh, it's this one right here.
                  Can't leave my friend.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  What I meant was
                  maybe we could go for a drink.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  I figure we could have a nice,
                  long chat about something you're into...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  like the whole revolution thing.

                  You're wrong!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - I have very high standards.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  It's not their looks that count.
                  It's their... I don't know......
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  A girl's sensitivity
                  that makes me do it.
                  
               </li>
               <li>

                  You're leaving just like that?

                  your name, you cold bitch!
                  
               </li>

               <li>

               </li>
               <li>
                  Why do you have to be hangin'
                  on my arm every minute?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  What about my bike?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Wha... Tetsuo?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - Is this okay?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Any sign of 'em?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Okay! Let's go!
                  
               </li>
               <li>

               </li>
               <li>
                  This whole thing happened because
                  you took my bike for a spin. Enough already.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  We were just worried.

               </li>
               <li>
                  Tetsuo... What's wrong?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Why don't you guys
                  just leave my friend alone?

               </li>
               <li>
                  - We could start over again.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - I'll go with you. So what do you think, huh?

               <li>
                  Turn yourself in!

               <li>
                  This was the first time
                  you killed a man, right?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  !- Anyway, when you get out...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  let's go out for drinks.
                  Don't kick yourself over it.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  What's done is done.

               <li>
                  Well, I guess if I say that I'm Kei's
                  boyfriend, it's stretching it a bit.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  It depends on your point of view.

               </li>
               <li>
                  If we don't get
                  out of here, those...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Huh?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Damn it, Tetsuo. Who the hell do you think
                  you're talking to, you moron?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  So is he off to find Akira?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Now, the army,
                  Ryu and yourself...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  are all trying at once
                  to find this Akira guy...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  and that's also why you're
                  chasing after Tetsuo.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  It must have to do
                  with the powers he's got.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  What the hell is this Akira thing?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  "Ultimate energy"?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Oh, yes...
                  It's in the genes, right?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  What's with all the crazy talk?
                  Are you sure you're okay?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Listen to yourself. Did you get
                  bonked on the head back there?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Akira is an amoeba then?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Is that what Tetsuo's doing?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Are you saying he has
                  that kind of energy?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Wha...!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Huh?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  It's a trap.
                  This is just too good of a setup.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - No way.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  I wanna find out how much
                  of a trap it is, don't you?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  By the way...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  what's going on with you
                  and that Ryu guy?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - You're always together.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  No, wait. Hear me out.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  What I'm saying is, he doesn't
                  know about us, does he?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  What? Yamagata's dead?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  We've always been together.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  I've known everything
                  about him ever...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  ever since we were
                  in the children's home together.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  They tease... Everybody
                  tried to make him cry.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Where my bike was?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  I'm gonna go send
                  Yamagata his wheels.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  You dumb bastard!

               <li>
                  Kei!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  What's wrong?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  That night. You were there.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Wait!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Kei!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  You're the one, right?
                  You changed my friend, didn't you?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Hey, who is that?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Great! Then what in the hell
                  did you take Kei for?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  They're people, not toys!
                  Bring her back to me!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  And Tetsuo's our friend,
                  not yours!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  If someone's gonna kill him,
                  it should be us!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Hey!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  This is what he wants,
                  isn't it?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  I wouldn't want to keep him
                  waiting now, would I?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  What's wrong?
                  Have some trouble?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Tetsuo,
                  you had me worried again.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  I figured you'd be standing here,
                  sobbing like a little baby.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  And now you're a boss, too,
                  of this pile of rumble.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - That's "Mister" Kaneda to you, punk!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Tetsuo!
                  
               </li>

               <li>
                  Huh?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  The damn battery's dead!

               <li>
                  Damn it!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  It ain't fair, Tetsuo!
                  Fight with your bare hands!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Tetsuo!

               <li>
                  Quick! The battery!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Hey, what's losing
                  a bike or two, huh?
                  
               </li>
               <li>

                  - This is the central wiring shaft, I think.

               <li>
                  I asked Ryu one time.

               <li>
                  He told me that Akira

               <li>
                  Humans do all kinds of things
                  during their lifetime, right?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Discover things......

               <li>
                  Build things......
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Things like houses, motorcycles...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  bridges and cities, rockets......
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  So where do you suppose all that
                  knowledge and energy comes from?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Humans were once
                  like monkeys, right?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  And before that,
                  like reptiles...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  and fish...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  and even before that,
                  plankton and amoebas.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Even little creatures like those
                  have incredible amount of energy inside them.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  And even before that.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Maybe there was genetic
                  material in the air and water...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  even in the particles
                  of dust in space.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  And if that's the truth, then what sort of memories
                  are hidden within them?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  The beginning of the universe?
                  Or maybe even before that.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  And what if everyone shares
                  those ancient memories?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  What if there were some mistakes
                  in the progression?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Then something goes wrong,
                  like an amoeba is suddenly given...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  the higher powers
                  that a human has.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Amoebas don't build their own
                  houses and bridges, do they?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  They just devour all the food
                  they can find around them.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  The door's unlocked.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - Go back, then.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  What in the world
                  are you talking about?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - That's none of your business.

               <li>
                  "About us"? Hey, wait a minute.

                  You shouldn't use your power in this way,

                  If he turns out
                  to reach a power like Akira's...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  are you positive that you are
                  able to control such power?

               <li>
                  Can you handle this?

               <li>
                  But maybe we weren't meant to
                  meddle with that ultimate power.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  But we have no choice
                  but to grasp that power...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  grasp that power
                  and learn to control it.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  And if this situation gets out
                  of hand, then he's to be terminated.
                  
               </li>
               <li>

               <li>
                  There. Now what's the matter?
                  Talk about it.

               <li>
                  Do you believe her?

                  I'll tell you, my job isn't to believe

                  We can't just trade one

                  Look at what they abandoned

               </li>
               <li>
                  They were afraid. They were too scared,

                  and abandoning the science

                  Now listen here! That power is starting

                  Unless we control that power now, we'll lose

                  That's good.

               <li>
                  How'd he find out about it?

               <li>
                  Then we'll follow him.

                  If you went in now, you'd

               <li>
                  If we went in there...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  we wouldn't be strong enough

                  You're right.

                  It's way too big

               </li>
               <li>
                  Because it has already begun.

                  Kiyoko says you'll wake him up

               <li>
                  when that happens,

               <li>
                  To prevent it,

               <li>
                  At this point in time, our only

               <li>
                  That's when we do it.
                  But will it really work?

               <li>
                  But he... None of this

               <li>
                  and for the three of us also

                  So the army's working
                  with the police...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  to hunt down antigovernment
                  groups, or so it seems.

               <li>
                  Speaking of Tetsuo, why the hell wouldn't they
                  tell us what hospital they threw him in?
                  
               </li>
               <li>

               <li>
                  Kuwata and the others went
                  to go look around Kisarazu.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  The only place we haven't
                  searched now is the industrial area.

                  Kaneda, what the hell's

                  Well, well. I see we have

               </li>
               <li>
                  doin' their thing in spite of the tight checkpoints
                  they got going around tonight.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  You mean "fish".
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Hey, Kaneda.
                  What are we gonna do?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - What the heck?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Here we go again. Look, let's get out of here
                  before we get caught up in it.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - Huh? Kaneda?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  And the checkpoints are
                  so strict these days.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Even the Clowns are
                  laying low.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Look!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  He's dead!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Who's that?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Why... Why are you here?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - Huh?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Yamagata!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Kaneda, wait!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Something seemed strange about him
                  the second I saw his face.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  It's odd. He was wearing what
                  looked like a white hospital gown.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  He acted like a different person.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Yamagata asked him
                  if he was really Tetsuo...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  or if he was someone else.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  And then he... Yamagata!
                  Why?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Oh. He really wanted to know
                  where your bike was at.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  What are you gonna do?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Kaneda!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  They're gone!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Are you sure you want
                  to do this alone?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  At least give me time
                  to get the gang together.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Hey, wait!

               <li>
                  Hey, Kaneda, hold on!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Hey, watch it, you jerk!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Move! Get out of the way!
                  Move it!
                  
               </li>
               <li>

                  Get on!

                  Come on!
                  My bike's burning up!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  What? Then there's nothing wrong
                  with using yours, right?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - Yeah, you did.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Huh? Oh, man! Oh!

               <li>
                  Look at that. We should get

                  I thought you were

               </li>
               <li>
                  Is he dead?

                  She cleared the hump,

               </li>
               <li>
                  I'll teach him a lesson.

                  If they think you're avoiding responsibility,

                  I'm terribly sorry to call you here,

               <li>
                  Colonel, please look at this.

               <li>
                  It's the special pattern
                  I'm getting from that young man.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  It doesn't resemble any
                  that I've seen so far...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  and I've never seen a developmental speed
                  or configuration like this.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  It may have begun with the shock of contact with
                  number 26, or it could be......
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  I'll show you right now.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  This projection is made using
                  mixed data, and the results are not quite correct...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  so a direct comparison is difficult.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  But I believe based on what we see here that
                  this boy's pattern is the key...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  to solving the riddle of
                  Akira's growth-pattern process.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - Thank you very much, sir.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  I'm certain he'll turn out to be a worthy addition
                  to the numbers, don't you?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  It may be rough on the boy...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  but I thought we might try starting him off with
                  level 7 capsules.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  I will take care of it.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Uh, well, that's a......
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Uh, well, then, in my opinion...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  if we can use the latest examination equipment
                  to collect even more data...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  and also do a multifaceted
                  analysis as we go, then surely......
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  You mean...
                  the power of a god?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - Yes, Colonel.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  What? No! Retrieve the
                  subject now! Hurry!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Well, there's, uh......
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  There seems to be nothing
                  physically wrong with her.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Her medication looks accurate.
                  There's no sign of any abnormalities...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  in her EKG or her EEG either.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  I think number 25's statement is probably
                  her precognitive power at work.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  You know, this needs to be brought
                  before the supreme council for inquiry.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  I have no doubts regarding
                  number 25's abilities.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  We have lots of data
                  that substantiate it.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  What do you believe, Colonel?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  The other day, a young researcher came to me
                  and asked me something.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  He wondered if their power was
                  the form of the next stage...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  that human evolution was taking, and perhaps
                  we would all be able to control it some day.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  But in spite of that,
                  you're trying to save the city.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  So then all systems are normal.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  What's the matter?
                  Is your head hurting?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Tetsuo Shima, your power
                  isn't fully matured yet.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  If you push yourself, you might do

               </li>
               <li>
                  But he can't control it, sir.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  He's developed so much power
                  in such a short time, it's unbelievable.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  We have confirmation of his recent

               <li>
                  coordinates 99871 by 4332.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  That's about 2 kilometers south of
                  the Olympic construction site...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  in the old city.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Magnificent.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - Colonel.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  We set up a camera in the

               </li>
               <li>
                  We have him under observation.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Colonel, you must take a look at this data.
                  It's phenomenal!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  We're still analyzing the energy
                  given off by the subject, but it's just magnificent.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Oh, yes, wonderful.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Of course, this is clearly
                  a proton collapse.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  We're also detecting a fair number of what
                  we believe to be unknown particles to science.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  If we can put this into
                  a theoretical framework...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  then physics...

               </li>
               <li>
                  humanity itself could know
                  the fundamental truths.

               <li>

               </li>
               <li>
                  we still haven't finished

               </li>
               <li>
                  Wait, Colonel.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  But, Colonel...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  I couldn't throw away
                  such a magnificent subject.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - I did, Colonel.

                  The city will crumble......

               <li>
                  So many people...
                  So many will die.

               <li>

               <li>
                  -I'm scared.

               <li>
                  Weirdo!

               <li>
                  That's enough!

               <li>
                  Stop it!

                  I won't tell.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  No! Don't! What you're
                  thinking is wrong! Akira is......
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Oh! Wait!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  What about you, Masaru?
                  You're bleeding.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  He flew away.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - Tetsuo went to where Akira is.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  He's heading for the facility below
                  the Olympic construction site.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Well, the fact that,
                  without us even looking...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  she turned up right under
                  our noses, says as much.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - What do you think?
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  The thing about Akira's power is...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  it exists within everyone
                  from the start.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  But when that power
                  is awakened inside...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  it is important to wisely
                  choose how to use it.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  When the time comes,
                  you might not know it...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  let alone be prepared for it.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Your friend
                  has already made his choice.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Tetsuo is our newest companion.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  He's our friend also.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  His actions are out of control...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  and for that
                  we're partly to blame too.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  We're hoping she'll be able
                  to help us in some way.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  We know the future doesn't necessarily proceed
                  along a single course.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  There ought to be a future we can choose.
                  It's up to us to find it.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Akira's here.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Hurry. Get into the tunnel.
                  You'll be safe in there.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  No, don't! Wait, Takashi!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  - Takashi!
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  But if the three of us tried...
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  maybe we could save that boy.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  Yes. We called
                  him here to the three of us.
                  
               </li>
               <li>
                  He's going to take
                  Tetsuo with him.
