    <line>Those lines that I before have writ do lie,</line>
    <line>Even those that said I could not love you dearer:</line>
    <line>Yet then my judgment knew no reason why</line>
    <line>My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.</line>
    <line>But reckoning Time, whose million'd accidents</line>
    <line>Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,</line>
    <line>Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,</line>
    <line>Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;</line>
    <line>Alas! why fearing of Time's tyranny,</line>
    <line>Might I not then say, 'Now I love you best,'</line>
    <line>When I was certain o'er incertainty,</line>
    <line>Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?</line>
    <line>Love is a babe, then might I not say so,</line>
    <line>To give full growth to that which still doth grow?</line>
