    <line>Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;</line>
    <line>And yet methinks I have astronomy,</line>
    <line>But not to tell of good or evil luck,</line>
    <line>Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;</line>
    <line>Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,</line>
    <line>Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,</line>
    <line>Or say with princes if it shall go well</line>
    <line>By oft predict that I in heaven find:</line>
    <line>But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,</line>
    <line>And constant stars in them I read such art</line>
    <line>As 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive,</line>
    <line>If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert';</line>
    <line>Or else of thee this I prognosticate:</line> 'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and
