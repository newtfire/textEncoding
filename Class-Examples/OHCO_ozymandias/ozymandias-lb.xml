    <layer agent="I">I met a traveller from an antique land,<lb/>
    <!--Notice! <lb/> is self-closing. -->
    Who said—<layer agent="traveller">“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <lb/>
    Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<lb/>
    Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<lb/>
    And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<lb/>
    Tell that its <layer agent="sculptor">sculptor well those passions read<lb/>
    Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<lb/>
    The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<lb/>
    And on the pedestal, these words appear:<lb/>
    <layer agent="pharaoh">My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<lb/>
    Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!</layer></layer><lb/>
    Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<lb/>
    Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<lb/>
        The lone and level sands stretch far away.”</layer><lb/>
