    <line>In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,</line>
    <line>But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;</line>
    <line>In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn,</line>
    <line>In vowing new hate after new love bearing:</line>
    <line>But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,</line>
    <line>When I break twenty? I am perjur'd most;</line>
    <line>For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,</line>
    <line>And all my honest faith in thee is lost:</line>
    <line>For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,</line>
    <line>Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy;</line>
    <line>And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,</line>
    <line>Or made them swear against the thing they see;</line>
    <line>For I have sworn thee fair; more perjur'd I,</line>
    <line>To swear against the truth so foul a lie!</line>
