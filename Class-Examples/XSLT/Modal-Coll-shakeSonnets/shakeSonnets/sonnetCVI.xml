    <line>When in the chronicle of wasted time</line>
    <line>I see descriptions of the fairest wights,</line>
    <line>And beauty making beautiful old rime,</line>
    <line>In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,</line>
    <line>Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,</line>
    <line>Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,</line>
    <line>I see their antique pen would have express'd</line>
    <line>Even such a beauty as you master now.</line>
    <line>So all their praises are but prophecies</line>
    <line>Of this our time, all you prefiguring;</line>
    <line>And for they looked but with divining eyes,</line>
    <line>They had not skill enough your worth to sing:</line>
    <line>For we, which now behold these present days,</line>
    <line>Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.</line>
