    <line>The forward violet thus did I chide:</line>
    <line>Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,</line>
    <line>If not from my love's breath? The purple pride</line>
    <line>Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells</line>
    <line>In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd.</line>
    <line>The lily I condemned for thy hand,</line>
    <line>And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair;</line>
    <line>The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,</line>
    <line>One blushing shame, another white despair;</line>
    <line>A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both,</line>
    <line>And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;</line>
    <line>But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth</line>
    <line>A vengeful canker eat him up to death.</line>
    <line>More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,</line>
    <line>But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.</line>
