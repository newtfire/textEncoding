    <line>Your love and pity doth the impression fill,</line>
    <line>Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;</line>
    <line>For what care I who calls me well or ill,</line>
    <line>So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?</line>
    <line>You are my all-the-world, and I must strive</line>
    <line>To know my shames and praises from your tongue;</line>
    <line>None else to me, nor I to none alive,</line>
    <line>That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.</line>
    <line>In so profound abysm I throw all care</line>
    <line>Of others' voices, that my adder's sense</line>
    <line>To critic and to flatterer stopped are.</line>
    <line>Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:</line>
    <line>You are so strongly in my purpose bred,</line>
    <line>That all the world besides methinks are dead.</line>
