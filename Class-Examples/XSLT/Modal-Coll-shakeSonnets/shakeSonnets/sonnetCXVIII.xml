    <line>Like as, to make our appetite more keen,</line>
    <line>With eager compounds we our palate urge;</line>
    <line>As, to prevent our maladies unseen,</line>
    <line>We sicken to shun sickness when we purge;</line>
    <line>Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,</line>
    <line>To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;</line>
    <line>And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness</line>
    <line>To be diseas'd, ere that there was true needing.</line>
    <line>Thus policy in love, to anticipate</line>
    <line>The ills that were not, grew to faults assur'd,</line>
    <line>And brought to medicine a healthful state</line>
    <line>Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cur'd;</line>
    <line>But thence I learn and find the lesson true,</line>
    <line>Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.</line>
