    <line>Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,</line>
    <line>But sad mortality o'ersways their power,</line>
    <line>How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,</line>
    <line>Whose action is no stronger than a flower?</line>
    <line>O! how shall summer's honey breath hold out,</line>
    <line>Against the wrackful siege of battering days,</line>
    <line>When rocks impregnable are not so stout,</line>
    <line>Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays?</line>
    <line>O fearful meditation! where, alack,</line>
    <line>Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?</line>
    <line>Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?</line>
    <line>Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?</line>
    <line>O! none, unless this miracle have might,</line>
    <line>That in black ink my love may still shine bright.</line>
