    <line>Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,</line>
    <line>Which I by lacking have supposed dead;</line>
    <line>And there reigns Love, and all Love's loving parts,</line>
    <line>And all those friends which I thought buried.</line>
    <line>How many a holy and obsequious tear</line>
    <line>Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,</line>
    <line>As interest of the dead, which now appear</line>
    <line>But things remov'd that hidden in thee lie!</line>
    <line>Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,</line>
    <line>Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,</line>
    <line>Who all their parts of me to thee did give,</line>
    <line>That due of many now is thine alone:</line>
    <line>Their images I lov'd, I view in thee,</line>
    <line>And thou--all they--hast all the all of me.</line>
