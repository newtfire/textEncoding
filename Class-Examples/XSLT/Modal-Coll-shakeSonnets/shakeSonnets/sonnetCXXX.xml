    <line>My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;</line>
    <line>Coral is far more red, than her lips red:</line>
    <line>If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;</line>
    <line>If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.</line>
    <line>I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,</line>
    <line>But no such roses see I in her cheeks;</line>
    <line>And in some perfumes is there more delight</line>
    <line>Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.</line>
    <line>I love to hear her speak, yet well I know</line>
    <line>That music hath a far more pleasing sound:</line>
    <line>I grant I never saw a goddess go,--</line>
    <line>My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:</line>
    <line>And yet by heaven, I think my love as rare,</line>
    <line>As any she belied with false compare.</line>
