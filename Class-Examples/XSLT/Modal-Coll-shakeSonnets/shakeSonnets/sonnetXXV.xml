    <line>Let those who are in favour with their stars</line>
    <line>Of public honour and proud titles boast,</line>
    <line>Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars</line>
    <line>Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.</line>
    <line>Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread</line>
    <line>But as the marigold at the sun's eye,</line>
    <line>And in themselves their pride lies buried,</line>
    <line>For at a frown they in their glory die.</line>
    <line>The painful warrior famoused for fight,</line>
    <line>After a thousand victories once foil'd,</line>
    <line>Is from the book of honour razed quite,</line>
    <line>And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:</line>
    <line>Then happy I, that love and am belov'd,</line>
    <line>Where I may not remove nor be remov'd.</line>
