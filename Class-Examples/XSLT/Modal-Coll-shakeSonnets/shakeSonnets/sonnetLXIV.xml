    <line>When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd</line>
    <line>The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age;</line>
    <line>When sometime lofty towers I see down-raz'd,</line>
    <line>And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;</line>
    <line>When I have seen the hungry ocean gain</line>
    <line>Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,</line>
    <line>And the firm soil win of the watery main,</line>
    <line>Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;</line>
    <line>When I have seen such interchange of state,</line>
    <line>Or state itself confounded, to decay;</line>
    <line>Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate--</line>
    <line>That Time will come and take my love away.</line>
    <line>This thought is as a death which cannot choose</line>
    <line>But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.</line>
