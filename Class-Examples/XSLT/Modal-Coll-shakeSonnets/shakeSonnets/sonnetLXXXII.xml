    <line>I grant thou wert not married to my Muse,</line>
    <line>And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook</line>
    <line>The dedicated words which writers use</line>
    <line>Of their fair subject, blessing every book.</line>
    <line>Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,</line>
    <line>Finding thy worth a limit past my praise;</line>
    <line>And therefore art enforced to seek anew</line>
    <line>Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.</line>
    <line>And do so, love; yet when they have devis'd,</line>
    <line>What strained touches rhetoric can lend,</line>
    <line>Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz'd</line>
    <line>In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;</line>
    <line>And their gross painting might be better us'd</line>
    <line>Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abus'd.</line>
