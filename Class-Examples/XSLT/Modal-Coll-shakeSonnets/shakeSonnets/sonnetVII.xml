    <line>Lo! in the orient when the gracious light</line>
    <line>Lifts up his burning head, each under eye</line>
    <line>Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,</line>
    <line>Serving with looks his sacred majesty;</line>
    <line>And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,</line>
    <line>Resembling strong youth in his middle age,</line>
    <line>Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,</line>
    <line>Attending on his golden pilgrimage:</line>
    <line>But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,</line>
    <line>Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,</line>
    <line>The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are</line>
    <line>From his low tract, and look another way:</line>
    <line>So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:</line>
    <line>Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son.</line>
