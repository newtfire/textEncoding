    <line>Lo, as a careful housewife runs to catch</line>
    <line>One of her feather'd creatures broke away,</line>
    <line>Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch</line>
    <line>In pursuit of the thing she would have stay;</line>
    <line>Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,</line>
    <line>Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent</line>
    <line>To follow that which flies before her face,</line>
    <line>Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;</line>
    <line>So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,</line>
    <line>Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;</line>
    <line>But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,</line>
    <line>And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind;</line>
    <line>So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'</line>
    <line>If thou turn back and my loud crying still.</line>
