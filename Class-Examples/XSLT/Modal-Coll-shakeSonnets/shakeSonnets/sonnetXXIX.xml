    <line>When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes</line>
    <line>I all alone beweep my outcast state,</line>
    <line>And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,</line>
    <line>And look upon myself, and curse my fate,</line>
    <line>Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,</line>
    <line>Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,</line>
    <line>Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,</line>
    <line>With what I most enjoy contented least;</line>
    <line>Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,</line>
    <line>Haply I think on thee,-- and then my state,</line>
    <line>Like to the lark at break of day arising</line>
    <line>From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;</line>
    <line>For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings</line>
    <line>That then I scorn to change my state with kings.</line>
