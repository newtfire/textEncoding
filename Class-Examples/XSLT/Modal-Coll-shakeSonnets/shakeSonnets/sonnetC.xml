    <line>Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,</line>
    <line>To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?</line>
    <line>Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,</line>
    <line>Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?</line>
    <line>Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,</line>
    <line>In gentle numbers time so idly spent;</line>
    <line>Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem</line>
    <line>And gives thy pen both skill and argument.</line>
    <line>Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,</line>
    <line>If Time have any wrinkle graven there;</line>
    <line>If any, be a satire to decay,</line>
    <line>And make time's spoils despised every where.</line>
    <line>Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,</line>
    <line>So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.</line>
