    <line>Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,</line>
    <line>My sinful earth these rebel powers array,</line>
    <line>Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,</line>
    <line>Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?</line>
    <line>Why so large cost, having so short a lease,</line>
    <line>Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?</line>
    <line>Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,</line>
    <line>Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?</line>
    <line>Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,</line>
    <line>And let that pine to aggravate thy store;</line>
    <line>Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;</line>
    <line>Within be fed, without be rich no more:</line>
    <line>So shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,</line>
    <line>And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.</line>
