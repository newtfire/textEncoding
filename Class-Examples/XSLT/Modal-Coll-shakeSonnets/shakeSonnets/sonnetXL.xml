    <line>Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all;</line>
    <line>What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?</line>
    <line>No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;</line>
    <line>All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more.</line>
    <line>Then, if for my love, thou my love receivest,</line>
    <line>I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest;</line>
    <line>But yet be blam'd, if thou thy self deceivest</line>
    <line>By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.</line>
    <line>I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,</line>
    <line>Although thou steal thee all my poverty:</line>
    <line>And yet, love knows it is a greater grief</line>
    <line>To bear love's wrong, than hate's known injury.</line>
    <line>Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,</line>
    <line>Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.</line>
