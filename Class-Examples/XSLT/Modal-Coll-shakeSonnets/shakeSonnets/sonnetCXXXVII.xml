    <line>Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,</line>
    <line>That they behold, and see not what they see?</line>
    <line>They know what beauty is, see where it lies,</line>
    <line>Yet what the best is take the worst to be.</line>
    <line>If eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks,</line>
    <line>Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,</line>
    <line>Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,</line>
    <line>Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?</line>
    <line>Why should my heart think that a several plot,</line>
    <line>Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?</line>
    <line>Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,</line>
    <line>To put fair truth upon so foul a face?</line>
    <line>In things right true my heart and eyes have err'd,</line>
    <line>And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.</line>
