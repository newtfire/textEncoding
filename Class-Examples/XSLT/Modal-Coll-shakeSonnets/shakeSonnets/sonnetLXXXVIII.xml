    <line>When thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light,</line>
    <line>And place my merit in the eye of scorn,</line>
    <line>Upon thy side, against myself I'll fight,</line>
    <line>And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.</line>
    <line>With mine own weakness, being best acquainted,</line>
    <line>Upon thy part I can set down a story</line>
    <line>Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted;</line>
    <line>That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:</line>
    <line>And I by this will be a gainer too;</line>
    <line>For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,</line>
    <line>The injuries that to myself I do,</line>
    <line>Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.</line>
    <line>Such is my love, to thee I so belong,</line>
    <line>That for thy right, myself will bear all wrong.</line>
