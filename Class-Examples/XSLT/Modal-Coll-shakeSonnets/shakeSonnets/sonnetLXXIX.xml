    <line>Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,</line>
    <line>My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;</line>
    <line>But now my gracious numbers are decay'd,</line>
    <line>And my sick Muse doth give an other place.</line>
    <line>I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument</line>
    <line>Deserves the travail of a worthier pen;</line>
    <line>Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent</line>
    <line>He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.</line>
    <line>He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word</line>
    <line>From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,</line>
    <line>And found it in thy cheek: he can afford</line>
    <line>No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.</line>
    <line>Then thank him not for that which he doth say,</line>
    <line>Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.</line>
