    <line>Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'</line>
    <line>And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus;</line>
    <line>More than enough am I that vex'd thee still,</line>
    <line>To thy sweet will making addition thus.</line>
    <line>Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,</line>
    <line>Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?</line>
    <line>Shall will in others seem right gracious,</line>
    <line>And in my will no fair acceptance shine?</line>
    <line>The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,</line>
    <line>And in abundance addeth to his store;</line>
    <line>So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'</line>
    <line>One will of mine, to make thy large will more.</line>
    <line>Let no unkind 'No' fair beseechers kill;</line>
    <line>Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'</line>
