    <line>Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,</line>
    <line>And make me travel forth without my cloak,</line>
    <line>To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,</line>
    <line>Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?</line> 'Tis not enough that through the cloud
    thou break, <line>To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,</line>
    <line>For no man well of such a salve can speak,</line>
    <line>That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:</line>
    <line>Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;</line>
    <line>Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:</line>
    <line>The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief</line>
    <line>To him that bears the strong offence's cross.</line>
    <line>Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,</line>
    <line>And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.</line>
