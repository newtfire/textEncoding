    <line>Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul</line>
    <line>Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,</line>
    <line>Can yet the lease of my true love control,</line>
    <line>Supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom.</line>
    <line>The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,</line>
    <line>And the sad augurs mock their own presage;</line>
    <line>Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,</line>
    <line>And peace proclaims olives of endless age.</line>
    <line>Now with the drops of this most balmy time,</line>
    <line>My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,</line>
    <line>Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rime,</line>
    <line>While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:</line>
    <line>And thou in this shalt find thy monument,</line>
    <line>When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.</line>
