    <line>O! that you were your self; but, love you are</line>
    <line>No longer yours, than you your self here live:</line>
    <line>Against this coming end you should prepare,</line>
    <line>And your sweet semblance to some other give:</line>
    <line>So should that beauty which you hold in lease</line>
    <line>Find no determination; then you were</line>
    <line>Yourself again, after yourself's decease,</line>
    <line>When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.</line>
    <line>Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,</line>
    <line>Which husbandry in honour might uphold,</line>
    <line>Against the stormy gusts of winter's day</line>
    <line>And barren rage of death's eternal cold?</line>
    <line>O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,</line>
    <line>You had a father: let your son say so.</line>
