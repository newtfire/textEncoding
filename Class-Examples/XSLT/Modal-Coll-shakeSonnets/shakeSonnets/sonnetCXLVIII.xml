    <line>O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,</line>
    <line>Which have no correspondence with true sight;</line>
    <line>Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,</line>
    <line>That censures falsely what they see aright?</line>
    <line>If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,</line>
    <line>What means the world to say it is not so?</line>
    <line>If it be not, then love doth well denote</line>
    <line>Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,</line>
    <line>How can it? O! how can Love's eye be true,</line>
    <line>That is so vexed with watching and with tears?</line>
    <line>No marvel then, though I mistake my view;</line>
    <line>The sun itself sees not, till heaven clears.</line>
    <line>O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,</line>
    <line>Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.</line>
