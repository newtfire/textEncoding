    <line>If thou survive my well-contented day,</line>
    <line>When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover</line>
    <line>And shalt by fortune once more re-survey</line>
    <line>These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,</line>
    <line>Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,</line>
    <line>And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,</line>
    <line>Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,</line>
    <line>Exceeded by the height of happier men.</line>
    <line>O! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:</line> 'Had my friend's Muse grown with this
    growing age, <line>A dearer birth than this his love had brought,</line>
    <line>To march in ranks of better equipage:</line>
    <line>But since he died and poets better prove,</line>
    <line>Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.</line>
