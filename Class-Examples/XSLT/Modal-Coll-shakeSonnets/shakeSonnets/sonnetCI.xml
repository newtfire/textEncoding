    <line>O truant Muse what shall be thy amends</line>
    <line>For thy neglect of truth in beauty dy'd?</line>
    <line>Both truth and beauty on my love depends;</line>
    <line>So dost thou too, and therein dignified.</line>
    <line>Make answer Muse: wilt thou not haply say,</line> 
    <line>'Truth needs no colour, with his colour
    fix'd;</line> 
  <line>Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;</line>
    <line>But best is best, if never intermix'd'?</line>
    <line>Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?</line>
    <line>Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee</line>
    <line>To make him much outlive a gilded tomb</line>
    <line>And to be prais'd of ages yet to be.</line>
    <line>Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how</line>
    <line>To make him seem long hence as he shows now.</line>
