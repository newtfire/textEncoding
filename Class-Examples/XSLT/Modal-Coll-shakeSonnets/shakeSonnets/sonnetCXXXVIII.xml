    <line>When my love swears that she is made of truth,</line>
    <line>I do believe her though I know she lies,</line>
    <line>That she might think me some untutor'd youth,</line>
    <line>Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.</line>
    <line>Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,</line>
    <line>Although she knows my days are past the best,</line>
    <line>Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:</line>
    <line>On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:</line>
    <line>But wherefore says she not she is unjust?</line>
    <line>And wherefore say not I that I am old?</line>
    <line>O! love's best habit is in seeming trust,</line>
    <line>And age in love, loves not to have years told:</line>
    <line>Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,</line>
    <line>And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.</line>
