    <line>They that have power to hurt, and will do none,</line>
    <line>That do not do the thing they most do show,</line>
    <line>Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,</line>
    <line>Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow;</line>
    <line>They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,</line>
    <line>And husband nature's riches from expense;</line>
    <line>They are the lords and owners of their faces,</line>
    <line>Others, but stewards of their excellence.</line>
    <line>The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,</line>
    <line>Though to itself, it only live and die,</line>
    <line>But if that flower with base infection meet,</line>
    <line>The basest weed outbraves his dignity:</line>
    <line>For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;</line>
    <line>Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.</line>
