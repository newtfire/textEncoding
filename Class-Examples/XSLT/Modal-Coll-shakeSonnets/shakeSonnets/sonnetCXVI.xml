    <line>Let me not to the marriage of true minds</line>
    <line>Admit impediments. Love is not love</line>
    <line>Which alters when it alteration finds,</line>
    <line>Or bends with the remover to remove:</line>
    <line>O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,</line>
    <line>That looks on tempests and is never shaken;</line>
    <line>It is the star to every wandering bark,</line>
    <line>Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.</line>
    <line>Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks</line>
    <line>Within his bending sickle's compass come;</line>
    <line>Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,</line>
    <line>But bears it out even to the edge of doom.</line>
    <line>If this be error and upon me prov'd,</line>
    <line>I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.</line>
