    <line>Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye</line>
    <line>And all my soul, and all my every part;</line>
    <line>And for this sin there is no remedy,</line>
    <line>It is so grounded inward in my heart.</line>
    <line>Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,</line>
    <line>No shape so true, no truth of such account;</line>
    <line>And for myself mine own worth do define,</line>
    <line>As I all other in all worths surmount.</line>
    <line>But when my glass shows me myself indeed</line>
    <line>Beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity,</line>
    <line>Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;</line>
    <line>Self so self-loving were iniquity.</line>
    <line>'Tis thee,--myself,--that for myself I praise,</line>
    <line>Painting my age with beauty of thy days.</line>
