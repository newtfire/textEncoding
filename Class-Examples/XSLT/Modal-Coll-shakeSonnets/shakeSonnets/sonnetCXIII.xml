    <line>Seems seeing, but effectually is out;</line>
    <line>For it no form delivers to the heart</line>
    <line>Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch:</line>
    <line>Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,</line>

    <line>The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,</line>
    <line>The mountain or the sea, the day or night:</line>
    <line>The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.</line>
    <line>Incapable of more, replete with you,</line>
    <line>My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.</line>
