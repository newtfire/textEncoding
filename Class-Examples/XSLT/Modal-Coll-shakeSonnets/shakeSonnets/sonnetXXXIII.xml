    <line>Full many a glorious morning have I seen</line>
    <line>Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,</line>
    <line>Kissing with golden face the meadows green,</line>
    <line>Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;</line>
    <line>Anon permit the basest clouds to ride</line>
    <line>With ugly rack on his celestial face,</line>
    <line>And from the forlorn world his visage hide,</line>
    <line>Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:</line>
    <line>Even so my sun one early morn did shine,</line>
    <line>With all triumphant splendour on my brow;</line>
    <line>But out! alack! he was but one hour mine,</line>
    <line>The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.</line>
    <line>Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;</line>
    <line>Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.</line>
