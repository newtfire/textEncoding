    <line>Against that time, if ever that time come,</line>
    <line>When I shall see thee frown on my defects,</line>
    <line>When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,</line>
    <line>Call'd to that audit by advis'd respects;</line>
    <line>Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,</line>
    <line>And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,</line>
    <line>When love, converted from the thing it was,</line>
    <line>Shall reasons find of settled gravity;</line>
    <line>Against that time do I ensconce me here,</line>
    <line>Within the knowledge of mine own desert,</line>
    <line>And this my hand, against my self uprear,</line>
    <line>To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:</line>
    <line>To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,</line>
    <line>Since why to love I can allege no cause.</line>
