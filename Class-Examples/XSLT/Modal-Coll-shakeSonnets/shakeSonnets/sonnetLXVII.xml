    <line>Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,</line>
    <line>And with his presence grace impiety,</line>
    <line>That sin by him advantage should achieve,</line>
    <line>And lace itself with his society?</line>
    <line>Why should false painting imitate his cheek,</line>
    <line>And steel dead seeming of his living hue?</line>
    <line>Why should poor beauty indirectly seek</line>
    <line>Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?</line>
    <line>Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,</line>
    <line>Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?</line>
    <line>For she hath no exchequer now but his,</line>
    <line>And proud of many, lives upon his gains.</line>
    <line>O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had</line>
    <line>In days long since, before these last so bad.</line>
