    <line>My love is as a fever longing still,</line>
    <line>For that which longer nurseth the disease;</line>
    <line>Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,</line>
    <line>The uncertain sickly appetite to please.</line>
    <line>My reason, the physician to my love,</line>
    <line>Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,</line>
    <line>Hath left me, and I desperate now approve</line>
    <line>Desire is death, which physic did except.</line>
    <line>Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,</line>
    <line>And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;</line>
    <line>My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,</line>
    <line>At random from the truth vainly express'd;</line>
    <line>For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,</line>
    <line>Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.</line>
