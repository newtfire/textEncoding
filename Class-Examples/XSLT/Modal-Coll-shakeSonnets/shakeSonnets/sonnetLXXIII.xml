    <line>That time of year thou mayst in me behold</line>
    <line>When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang</line>
    <line>Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,</line>
    <line>Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.</line>
    <line>In me thou see'st the twilight of such day</line>
    <line>As after sunset fadeth in the west;</line>
    <line>Which by and by black night doth take away,</line>
    <line>Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.</line>
    <line>In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,</line>
    <line>That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,</line>
    <line>As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,</line>
    <line>Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.</line>
    <line>This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,</line>
    <line>To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.</line>
