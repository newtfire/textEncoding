    <line>Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd,</line>
    <line>Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;</line>
    <line>My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,</line>
    <line>And perspective it is best painter's art.</line>
    <line>For through the painter must you see his skill,</line>
    <line>To find where your true image pictur'd lies,</line>
    <line>Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,</line>
    <line>That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.</line>
    <line>Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:</line>
    <line>Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me</line>
    <line>Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun</line>
    <line>Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;</line>
    <line>Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,</line>
    <line>They draw but what they see, know not the heart.</line>
