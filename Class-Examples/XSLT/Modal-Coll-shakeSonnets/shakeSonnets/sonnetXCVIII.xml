    <line>From you have I been absent in the spring,</line>
    <line>When proud-pied April, dress'd in all his trim,</line>
    <line>Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,</line>
    <line>That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.</line>
    <line>Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell</line>
    <line>Of different flowers in odour and in hue,</line>
    <line>Could make me any summer's story tell,</line>
    <line>Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:</line>
    <line>Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,</line>
    <line>Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;</line>
    <line>They were but sweet, but figures of delight,</line>
    <line>Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.</line>
    <line>Yet seem'd it winter still, and you away,</line>
    <line>As with your shadow I with these did play.</line>
