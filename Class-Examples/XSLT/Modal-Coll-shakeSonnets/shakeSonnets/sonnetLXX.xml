    <line>That thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect,</line>

    <line>So thou be good, slander doth but approve</line>
    <line>Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time;</line>

    <line>Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days</line>
    <line>Either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd;</line>
    <line>Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,</line>
    <line>To tie up envy, evermore enlarg'd,</line>
