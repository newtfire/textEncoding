    <line>My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,</line>
    <line>While comments of your praise richly compil'd,</line>
    <line>Reserve their character with golden quill,</line>
    <line>And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd.</line>
    <line>I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,</line>
    <line>And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen'</line>
    <line>To every hymn that able spirit affords,</line>
    <line>In polish'd form of well-refined pen.</line>
    <line>Hearing you praised, I say ''tis so, 'tis true,'</line>
    <line>And to the most of praise add something more;</line>
    <line>But that is in my thought, whose love to you,</line>
    <line>Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.</line>
    <line>Then others, for the breath of words respect,</line>
    <line>Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.</line>
