    <line>Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;</line>
    <line>Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;</line>
    <line>Both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less:</line>
    <line>Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort.</line>
    <line>As on the finger of a throned queen</line>
    <line>The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,</line>
    <line>So are those errors that in thee are seen</line>
    <line>To truths translated, and for true things deem'd.</line>
    <line>How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,</line>
    <line>If like a lamb he could his looks translate!</line>
    <line>How many gazers mightst thou lead away,</line>
    <line>if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!</line>
    <line>But do not so; I love thee in such sort,</line>
    <line>As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.</line>
