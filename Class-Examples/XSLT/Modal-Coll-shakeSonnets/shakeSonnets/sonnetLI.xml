    <line>Thus can my love excuse the slow offence</line>
    <line>Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:</line>
    <line>From where thou art why should I haste me thence?</line>
    <line>Till I return, of posting is no need.</line>
    <line>O! what excuse will my poor beast then find,</line>
    <line>When swift extremity can seem but slow?</line>
    <line>Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind,</line>
    <line>In winged speed no motion shall I know,</line>
    <line>Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;</line>
    <line>Therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made,</line>
    <line>Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;</line>
    <line>But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,--</line> 'Since from thee going, he went
    wilful-slow, <line>Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.'</line>
