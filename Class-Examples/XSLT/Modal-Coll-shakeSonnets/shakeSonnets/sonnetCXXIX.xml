    <line>The expense of spirit in a waste of shame</line>
    <line>Is lust in action: and till action, lust</line>
    <line>Is perjur'd, murderous, bloody, full of blame,</line>
    <line>Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;</line>
    <line>Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight;</line>
    <line>Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,</line>
    <line>Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait,</line>
    <line>On purpose laid to make the taker mad:</line>
    <line>Mad in pursuit and in possession so;</line>
    <line>Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme;</line>
    <line>A bliss in proof,-- and prov'd, a very woe;</line>
    <line>Before, a joy propos'd; behind a dream.</line>
    <line>All this the world well knows; yet none knows well</line>
    <line>To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.</line>
