    <line>When to the sessions of sweet silent thought</line>
    <line>I summon up remembrance of things past,</line>
    <line>I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,</line>
    <line>And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:</line>
    <line>Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,</line>
    <line>For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,</line>
    <line>And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,</line>
    <line>And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:</line>
    <line>Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,</line>
    <line>And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er</line>
    <line>The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,</line>
    <line>Which I new pay as if not paid before.</line>
    <line>But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,</line>
    <line>All losses are restor'd and sorrows end.</line>
