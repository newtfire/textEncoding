    <line>Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,</line>
    <line>Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?</line>
    <line>Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,</line>
    <line>And that your love taught it this alchemy,</line>
    <line>To make of monsters and things indigest</line>
    <line>Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,</line>
    <line>Creating every bad a perfect best,</line>
    <line>As fast as objects to his beams assemble?</line>
    <line>O! 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,</line>
    <line>And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:</line>
    <line>Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,</line>
    <line>And to his palate doth prepare the cup:</line>
    <line>If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin</line>
    <line>That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.</line>
