    <line>Not marble, nor the gilded monuments</line>
    <line>Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;</line>
    <line>But you shall shine more bright in these contents</line>
    <line>Than unswept stone, besmear'd with sluttish time.</line>
    <line>When wasteful war shall statues overturn,</line>
    <line>And broils root out the work of masonry,</line>
    <line>Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn</line>
    <line>The living record of your memory.</line>
    <line>'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity</line>
    <line>Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room</line>
    <line>Even in the eyes of all posterity</line>
    <line>That wear this world out to the ending doom.</line>
    <line>So, till the judgment that yourself arise,</line>
    <line>You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.</line>
