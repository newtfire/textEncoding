    <line>That you were once unkind befriends me now,</line>
    <line>And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,</line>
    <line>Needs must I under my transgression bow,</line>
    <line>Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.</line>
    <line>For if you were by my unkindness shaken,</line>
    <line>As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time;</line>
    <line>And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken</line>
    <line>To weigh how once I suffer'd in your crime.</line>
    <line>O! that our night of woe might have remember'd</line>
    <line>My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,</line>
    <line>And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd</line>
    <line>The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!</line>
    <line>But that your trespass now becomes a fee;</line>
    <line>Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.</line>
