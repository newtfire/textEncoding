    <line>Who will believe my verse in time to come,</line>
    <line>If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?</line>
    <line>Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb</line>
    <line>Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.</line>
    <line>If I could write the beauty of your eyes,</line>
    <line>And in fresh numbers number all your graces,</line>
    <line>The age to come would say 'This poet lies;</line>
    <line>Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'</line>
    <line>So should my papers, yellow'd with their age,</line>
    <line>Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,</line>
    <line>And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage</line>
    <line>And stretched metre of an antique song:</line>
    <line>But were some child of yours alive that time,</line>
    <line>You should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme.</line>
