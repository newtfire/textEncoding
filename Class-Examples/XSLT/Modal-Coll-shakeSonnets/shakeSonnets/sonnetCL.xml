    <line>O! from what power hast thou this powerful might,</line>
    <line>With insufficiency my heart to sway?</line>
    <line>To make me give the lie to my true sight,</line>
    <line>And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?</line>
    <line>Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,</line>
    <line>That in the very refuse of thy deeds</line>
    <line>There is such strength and warrantise of skill,</line>
    <line>That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?</line>
    <line>Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,</line>
    <line>The more I hear and see just cause of hate?</line>
    <line>O! though I love what others do abhor,</line>
    <line>With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:</line>
    <line>If thy unworthiness rais'd love in me,</line>
    <line>More worthy I to be belov'd of thee.</line>
