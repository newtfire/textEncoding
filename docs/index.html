            <li>HTML for GitHub Pages Exercise 2: Continuing with styling and adding pages</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is <a href="copy-and-rename-to-docs/index.html">a starter homepage</a> we are sharing in these exercises as a launching point for your own GitHub Pages site. The starter page is named index.html and is located in the directory below the one publishing this page. Why is it named <code>index.html</code>? A homepage should be saved as index.html, to be identified as the  main page of a website. </p>
