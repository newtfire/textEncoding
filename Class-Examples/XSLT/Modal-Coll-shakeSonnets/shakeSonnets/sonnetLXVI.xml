    <line>Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,</line>
    <line>As to behold desert a beggar born,</line>
    <line>And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,</line>
    <line>And purest faith unhappily forsworn,</line>
    <line>And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,</line>
    <line>And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,</line>
    <line>And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,</line>
    <line>And strength by limping sway disabled</line>
    <line>And art made tongue-tied by authority,</line>
    <line>And folly--doctor-like--controlling skill,</line>
    <line>And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,</line>
    <line>And captive good attending captain ill:</line>
    <line>Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone,</line>
    <line>Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.</line>
