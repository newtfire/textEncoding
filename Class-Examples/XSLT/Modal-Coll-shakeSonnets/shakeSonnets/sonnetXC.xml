    <line>Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;</line>
    <line>Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,</line>
    <line>Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,</line>
    <line>And do not drop in for an after-loss:</line>
    <line>Ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scap'd this sorrow,</line>
    <line>Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;</line>
    <line>Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,</line>
    <line>To linger out a purpos'd overthrow.</line>
    <line>If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,</line>
    <line>When other petty griefs have done their spite,</line>
    <line>But in the onset come: so shall I taste</line>
    <line>At first the very worst of fortune's might;</line>
    <line>And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,</line>
    <line>Compar'd with loss of thee, will not seem so.</line>
