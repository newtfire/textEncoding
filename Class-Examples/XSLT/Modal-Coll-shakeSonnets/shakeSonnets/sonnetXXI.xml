    <line>So is it not with me as with that Muse,</line>
    <line>Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,</line>
    <line>Who heaven itself for ornament doth use</line>
    <line>And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,</line>
    <line>Making a couplement of proud compare'</line>
    <line>With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,</line>
    <line>With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,</line>
    <line>That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.</line>
    <line>O! let me, true in love, but truly write,</line>
    <line>And then believe me, my love is as fair</line>
    <line>As any mother's child, though not so bright</line>
    <line>As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:</line>
    <line>Let them say more that like of hearsay well;</line>
    <line>I will not praise that purpose not to sell.</line>
