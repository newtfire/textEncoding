    <line>Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view</line>
    <line>Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;</line>
    <line>All tongues--the voice of souls--give thee that due,</line>
    <line>Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.</line>
    <line>Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;</line>
    <line>But those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,</line>
    <line>In other accents do this praise confound</line>
    <line>By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.</line>
    <line>They look into the beauty of thy mind,</line>
    <line>And that in guess they measure by thy deeds;</line>
    <line>Then--churls--their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,</line>
    <line>To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:</line>
    <line>But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,</line>
    <line>The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.</line>
