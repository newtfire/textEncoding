    <line>For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,</line>
    <line>Who for thy self art so unprovident.</line>
    <line>Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,</line>
    <line>But that thou none lov'st is most evident:</line>
    <line>For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate,</line>
    <line>That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,</line>
    <line>Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate</line>
    <line>Which to repair should be thy chief desire.</line>
    <line>O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:</line>
    <line>Shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love?</line>
    <line>Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,</line>
    <line>Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:</line>
    <line>Make thee another self for love of me,</line>
    <line>That beauty still may live in thine or thee.</line>
