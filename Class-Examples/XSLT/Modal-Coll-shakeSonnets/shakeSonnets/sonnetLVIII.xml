    <line>That god forbid, that made me first your slave,</line>
    <line>I should in thought control your times of pleasure,</line>
    <line>Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,</line>
    <line>Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!</line>
    <line>O! let me suffer, being at your beck,</line>
    <line>The imprison'd absence of your liberty;</line>
    <line>And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,</line>
    <line>Without accusing you of injury.</line>
    <line>Be where you list, your charter is so strong</line>
    <line>That you yourself may privilage your time</line>
    <line>To what you will; to you it doth belong</line>
    <line>Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.</line>
    <line>I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,</line>
    <line>Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.</line>
