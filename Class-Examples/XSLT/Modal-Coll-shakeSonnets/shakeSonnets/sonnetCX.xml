    <line>Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,</line>
    <line>And made my self a motley to the view,</line>
    <line>Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,</line>
    <line>Made old offences of affections new;</line>
    <line>Most true it is, that I have look'd on truth</line>
    <line>Askance and strangely; but, by all above,</line>
    <line>These blenches gave my heart another youth,</line>
    <line>And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.</line>
    <line>Now all is done, save what shall have no end:</line>
    <line>Mine appetite I never more will grind</line>
    <line>On newer proof, to try an older friend,</line>
    <line>A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.</line>
    <line>Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,</line>
    <line>Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.</line>
