    <line>If my dear love were but the child of state,</line>
    <line>It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd,</line>
    <line>As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,</line>
    <line>Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.</line>
    <line>No, it was builded far from accident;</line>
    <line>It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls</line>
    <line>Under the blow of thralled discontent,</line>
    <line>Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:</line>
    <line>It fears not policy, that heretic,</line>
    <line>Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,</line>
    <line>But all alone stands hugely politic,</line>
    <line>That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.</line>
    <line>To this I witness call the fools of time,</line>
    <line>Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.</line>
