    <line>The little Love-god lying once asleep,</line>
    <line>Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,</line>
    <line>Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep</line>
    <line>Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand</line>
    <line>The fairest votary took up that fire</line>
    <line>Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;</line>
    <line>And so the general of hot desire</line>
    <line>Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarm'd.</line>
    <line>This brand she quenched in a cool well by,</line>
    <line>Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,</line>
    <line>Growing a bath and healthful remedy,</line>
    <line>For men diseas'd; but I, my mistress' thrall,</line>
    <line>Came there for cure and this by that I prove,</line>
    <line>Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.</line>
