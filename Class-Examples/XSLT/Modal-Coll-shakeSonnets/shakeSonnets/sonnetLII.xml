    <line>So am I as the rich, whose blessed key,</line>
    <line>Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,</line>
    <line>The which he will not every hour survey,</line>
    <line>For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.</line>
    <line>Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,</line>
    <line>Since, seldom coming in that long year set,</line>
    <line>Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,</line>
    <line>Or captain jewels in the carcanet.</line>
    <line>So is the time that keeps you as my chest,</line>
    <line>Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,</line>
    <line>To make some special instant special-blest,</line>
    <line>By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.</line>
    <line>Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,</line>
    <line>Being had, to triumph; being lacked, to hope.</line>
