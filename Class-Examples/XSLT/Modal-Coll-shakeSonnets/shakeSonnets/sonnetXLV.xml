    <line>The other two, slight air, and purging fire</line>
    <line>Are both with thee, wherever I abide;</line>
    <line>The first my thought, the other my desire,</line>
    <line>These present-absent with swift motion slide.</line>
    <line>For when these quicker elements are gone</line>
    <line>In tender embassy of love to thee,</line>
    <line>My life, being made of four, with two alone</line>
    <line>Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;</line>
    <line>Until life's composition be recur'd</line>
    <line>By those swift messengers return'd from thee,</line>
    <line>Who even but now come back again, assur'd,</line>
    <line>Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:</line>
    <line>This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,</line>
    <line>I send them back again, and straight grow sad.</line>
