    <line>Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,</line>
    <line>Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:</line>
    <line>O! but with mine compare thou thine own state,</line>
    <line>And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;</line>
    <line>Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,</line>
    <line>That have profan'd their scarlet ornaments</line>
    <line>And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,</line>
    <line>Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.</line>
    <line>Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lov'st those</line>
    <line>Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:</line>
    <line>Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,</line>
    <line>Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.</line>
    <line>If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,</line>
    <line>By self-example mayst thou be denied!</line>
