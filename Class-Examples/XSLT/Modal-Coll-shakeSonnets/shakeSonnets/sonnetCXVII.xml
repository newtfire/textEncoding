    <line>Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all,</line>
    <line>Wherein I should your great deserts repay,</line>
    <line>Forgot upon your dearest love to call,</line>
    <line>Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;</line>
    <line>That I have frequent been with unknown minds,</line>
    <line>And given to time your own dear-purchas'd right;</line>
    <line>That I have hoisted sail to all the winds</line>
    <line>Which should transport me farthest from your sight.</line>
    <line>Book both my wilfulness and errors down,</line>
    <line>And on just proof surmise, accumulate;</line>
    <line>Bring me within the level of your frown,</line>
    <line>But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;</line>
    <line>Since my appeal says I did strive to prove</line>
    <line>The constancy and virtue of your love.</line>
