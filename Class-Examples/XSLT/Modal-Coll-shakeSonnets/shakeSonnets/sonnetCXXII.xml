    <line>Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain</line>
    <line>Full character'd with lasting memory,</line>
    <line>Which shall above that idle rank remain,</line>
    <line>Beyond all date; even to eternity:</line>
    <line>Or, at the least, so long as brain and heart</line>
    <line>Have faculty by nature to subsist;</line>
    <line>Till each to raz'd oblivion yield his part</line>
    <line>Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.</line>
    <line>That poor retention could not so much hold,</line>
    <line>Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;</line>
    <line>Therefore to give them from me was I bold,</line>
    <line>To trust those tables that receive thee more:</line>
    <line>To keep an adjunct to remember thee</line>
    <line>Were to import forgetfulness in me.</line>
