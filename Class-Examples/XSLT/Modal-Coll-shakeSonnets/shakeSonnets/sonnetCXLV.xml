    <line>Those lips that Love's own hand did make,</line>
    <line>Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',</line>
    <line>To me that languish'd for her sake:</line>
    <line>But when she saw my woeful state,</line>
    <line>Straight in her heart did mercy come,</line>
    <line>Chiding that tongue that ever sweet</line>
    <line>Was us'd in giving gentle doom;</line>
    <line>And taught it thus anew to greet;</line>
    <line>'I hate' she alter'd with an end, </line>
    <line>That followed it as gentle day,</line>
    <line>Doth follow night, who like a fiend</line>
    <line>From heaven to hell is flown away.</line>
    <line>'I hate', from hate away she threw, </line>
    <line>And sav'd my life, saying 'not you'.</line>
