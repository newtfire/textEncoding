  <line>Let not my love be call'd idolatry,</line>
  <line>Nor my beloved as an idol show,</line>
  <line>Since all alike my songs and praises be</line>
  <line>To one, of one, still such, and ever so.</line>
  <line>Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,</line>
  <line>Still constant in a wondrous excellence;</line>
  <line>Therefore my verse to constancy confin'd,</line>
  <line>One thing expressing, leaves out difference.</line>
  <line> 'Fair, kind, and true,' is all my argument,</line>
  <line>'Fair, kind, and true,' varying to other words;</line>
  <line>And in this change is my invention spent,</line>
  <line>Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.</line>
  <line>Fair, kind, and true, have often liv'd alone,</line>
  <line>Which three till now, never kept seat in one.</line>
