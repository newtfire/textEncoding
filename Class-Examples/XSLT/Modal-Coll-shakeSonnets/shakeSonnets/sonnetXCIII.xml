    <line>So shall I live, supposing thou art true,</line>
    <line>Like a deceived husband; so love's face</line>
    <line>May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;</line>
    <line>Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:</line>
    <line>For there can live no hatred in thine eye,</line>
    <line>Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.</line>
    <line>In many's looks, the false heart's history</line>
    <line>Is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange.</line>
    <line>But heaven in thy creation did decree</line>
    <line>That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;</line>
    <line>Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,</line>
    <line>Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.</line>
    <line>How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,</line>
    <line>If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!</line>
