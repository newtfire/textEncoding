    <line>How heavy do I journey on the way,</line>
    <line>When what I seek, my weary travel's end,</line>
    <line>Doth teach that ease and that repose to say,</line> 'Thus far the miles are measured from
    thy friend!' <line>The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,</line>
    <line>Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,</line>
    <line>As if by some instinct the wretch did know</line>
    <line>His rider lov'd not speed, being made from thee:</line>
    <line>The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,</line>
    <line>That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,</line>
    <line>Which heavily he answers with a groan,</line>
    <line>More sharp to me than spurring to his side;</line>
    <line>For that same groan doth put this in my mind,</line>
    <line>My grief lies onward, and my joy behind.</line>
