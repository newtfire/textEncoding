    <line>Against my love shall be as I am now,</line>
    <line>With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn;</line>
    <line>When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow</line>
    <line>With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn</line>
    <line>Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night;</line>
    <line>And all those beauties whereof now he's king</line>
    <line>Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,</line>
    <line>Stealing away the treasure of his spring;</line>
    <line>For such a time do I now fortify</line>
    <line>Against confounding age's cruel knife,</line>
    <line>That he shall never cut from memory</line>
    <line>My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:</line>
    <line>His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,</line>
    <line>And they shall live, and he in them still green.</line>
