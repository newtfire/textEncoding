    <line>In the old age black was not counted fair,</line>
    <line>Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;</line>
    <line>But now is black beauty's successive heir,</line>
    <line>And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:</line>
    <line>For since each hand hath put on Nature's power,</line>
    <line>Fairing the foul with Art's false borrowed face,</line>
    <line>Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,</line>
    <line>But is profan'd, if not lives in disgrace.</line>
    <line>Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,</line>
    <line>Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem</line>
    <line>At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,</line>
    <line>Sland'ring creation with a false esteem:</line>
    <line>Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,</line>
    <line>That every tongue says beauty should look so.</line>
