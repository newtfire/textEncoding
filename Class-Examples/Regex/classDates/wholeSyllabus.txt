Week 2	Topics	Do before class	Group A	Group B
M 08-31	Discussion of XML homework. More explanation of how to work with distinct identifiers: @xml:id attributes and pointer attributes (#): Prosopography lists. Self-closing elements.	Complete XML Exercise 2:
First, revise the code in your XML Exercise 1: Try adding tags and attributes to help track more specific pieces of information than you marked at first. Try marking people and places, for example.
Look for pseudomarkup to convert into markup
Choose another letter in the collection from XML Exercise 1 and try to encode it the same way.
Optional: Try making a personography or a placeography list (even a partial one) of distinct people or places mentioned in the two letters. This can be a third file, or embedded as a section in each letter. Code the entries in this list to hold distinct names and any other information you wish, and give each entry an @xml:id attribute to hold a short distinct identifier you can use in your code. Then, apply pointer attributes (maybe @who, or @where or @ptr or @ref) in the markup of people or places in the body of the letters to point to entries to the personography or placeography using hashtags so you do not duplicate the xml:id. Where the xml:id would be coded only once on a page or in a project like so: identifier, the values of pointers can be used as many times as you like, and are just preceded with a hashmark like this: #identifier.
Submit your revised letter XML and new letter XML (and optional personography/placeography) on Canvas for XML Exercise 2.

W 09-09	
Seven Days of Git/GitHub. Start by (carefully) cleaning up our textEncoding-Hub? ALWAYS PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH!
Prepare for XM Test 1: Pre-Test Class Exercise:
git pull from textEncoding-Hub.
Open oXygen XML Editor. Open a file from textEncoding-Hub > Class-Examples > xmlPreTest
Open the file inside: ozyMeta.xml in oXygen. (If trouble with git pull, copy and paste the file into a new XML document from here.)
IMPORTANT! Save this file OUTSIDE of our textEncoding-Hub, so you don't save over my Class Examples as you are working. Save to your personal repo or to your Desktop or elsewhere on your computer!
Work in oXygen on finding and correcting errors that break XML form. With each error, document your correction: write an XML comment explaining what you did to correct the problem.
Keep making corrections until XML is well formed (and oXygen is green). Do your best! This is like the exam you will be taking over the weekend.
Emily Dickinson Projects: Exploration
Git Shell Practice (starting today for seven days): Make sure your personal repo and the class repo are properly set up and cloned to your computer. Using your Bash shell, practice some basic git commands to build a habit. On alternating days, push to the other repo (if you pushed to your personal repo today, tomorrow you will pull and push a file to our class repo). Remember: ALWAYS PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH!
Start exploring/responding to the Comparison of Emily Dickinson Projects on the textEncoding-Hub.

Make a folder to hold this homework, since it will contain two files. Save the folder using our homework filenaming conventions.
Open this goodMorning.xml file (open the link, and right-click to save on your computer with your homework, then open in oXygen).
Open a new Relax-NG Compact syntax file in oXygen, and set your editor in tile view so you can see the goodMorning.xml file next to your schema file. Delete the code in the Relax NG file so you have a blank slate to start with.
Write a Relax NG Schema in Compact Syntax that models the content of this XML file as you study it. (Save the schema in the same directory with your XML file so you can easily find it.)
Associate the schema with the XML file (in oXygen go to Document > Schema > Associate Schema, and browse to locate the schema. Click OK and note the new schema line at the top of your XML file.
Zip (compress) the file directory holding your XML file and the Relax NG schema file, and submit this on Canvas at the upload point for this assignment.
Review XML syntax and consult the Intro to Relax NG as you work on this, and ask for help on out textEncoding-Hub by opening an issue if you get stuck. Continue GitHub practice!	Zoom remotely	Kochel 77 + Zoom (audio muted)
