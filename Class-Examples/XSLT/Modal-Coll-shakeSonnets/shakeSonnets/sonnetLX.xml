    <line>Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,</line>
    <line>So do our minutes hasten to their end;</line>
    <line>Each changing place with that which goes before,</line>
    <line>In sequent toil all forwards do contend.</line>
    <line>Nativity, once in the main of light,</line>
    <line>Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,</line>
    <line>Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,</line>
    <line>And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.</line>
    <line>Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth</line>
    <line>And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,</line>
    <line>Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,</line>
    <line>And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:</line>
    <line>And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand.</line>
    <line>Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.</line>
