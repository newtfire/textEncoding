    <line>How like a winter hath my absence been</line>
    <line>From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!</line>
    <line>What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!</line>
    <line>What old December's bareness everywhere!</line>
    <line>And yet this time removed was summer's time;</line>
    <line>The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,</line>
    <line>Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,</line>
    <line>Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:</line>
    <line>Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me</line>
    <line>But hope of orphans, and unfather'd fruit;</line>
    <line>For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,</line>
    <line>And, thou away, the very birds are mute:</line>
    <line>Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,</line>
    <line>That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.</line>
