    <line>What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,</line>
    <line>Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,</line>
    <line>Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,</line>
    <line>Still losing when I saw myself to win!</line>
    <line>What wretched errors hath my heart committed,</line>
    <line>Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!</line>
    <line>How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted,</line>
    <line>In the distraction of this madding fever!</line>
    <line>O benefit of ill! now I find true</line>
    <line>That better is, by evil still made better;</line>
    <line>And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,</line>
    <line>Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.</line>
    <line>So I return rebuk'd to my content,</line>
    <line>And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.</line>
